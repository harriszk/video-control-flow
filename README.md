# Video Flow Control

Please note that this is a personal project and further development is necessary. 

This is a C++ application designed to provide users with the ability to manage and
process multiple streams of video data originating from various sources, including
remote devices such as satellites, IP cameras, and more. It is aimed at providing
a self-reliant solution for managing and processing video data. The application
offers a range of functionalities to manipulate and interact with video streams
programmatically. Users can save videos locally, stream them to other platforms,
and implement custom video processing algorithms. This application empowers users
with full control over their video processing workflow and facilitates the
seamless integration of custom functionalities through its flexible interface
system.

# Key Features

**Local Video Data Management**: The server application allows users to handle
video data from various sources, such as cameras or remote devices, within their
local environment.

**Flexible Video Processing**: With the ability to implement custom video processing
algorithms and functionalities using C++, users can tailor the server application
to their specific needs. This flexibility enables a wide range of video manipulation
and analysis capabilities.

**Video Recording and Storage**: Users can easily save video data to local storage
for future reference or analysis. The server application provides efficient methods
for recording and organizing video files.

**Streaming to External Platforms**: Users can effortlessly stream video data
to external platforms, facilitating real-time sharing and broadcasting of video
content.

**Customizable User Interface**: While the server primarily operates in the
background, a user interface component can be included for convenient configuration
and monitoring purposes. The interface allows users to adjust settings, visualize
video streams, and interact with the server's functionalities.
